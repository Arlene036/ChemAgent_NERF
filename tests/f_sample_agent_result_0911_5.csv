CC(C)(C)OC(=O)Nc1nc(Br)ns1.CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(B(O)O)cc1,C1COCCO1.O.[Cs+].[F-].[Pd],"Answer1: The possible product SMILES is ""CC(C)(C)OC(=O)Nc1nc(c2ccc(S(C)(=O)=O)cc2)ns1"". Answer2: The changes of functional groups during the reaction include the disappearance of alcohol groups, halogens, and side-chain hydroxyls, and the introduction of a new aromatic ring to the heterocycle."
C#CCNC(=O)OC(C)(C)C.COC(=O)c1ccc(Br)s1,CC#N.CCN(CC)CC.CCOC(C)=O.[Cu]I,"Answer1: The predicted product SMILES is Br.C#CC(NC(=O)OC(C)(C)C)c1ccc(C(=O)OC)s1.CC=N.CCN(CC)CC.CCOC(C)=O.[Cu]I. Answer2: The functional groups in the reactants are esters, ketones, amides, carbonyl methylester, halogens, t-butyl, acetylenes, and methoxy. After the reaction, the functional groups in the product are esters, ketones, amides, carbonyl methylester, terminal aldehyde, carbonyl methyl, halogens, t-butyl, acetylenes, ethoxy, and methoxy. The changes in functional groups during the reaction are the formation of a terminal aldehyde and carbonyl methyl, and the replacement of a methoxy group with an ethoxy group."
CC(C)(C)OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1F.CN(C)C=O,CCOCC.Cc1ccccc1.O.[Li]C(C)(C)C,"Answer1: The possible product SMILES is C=O.CC(C)(C)OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1F.CC(C)C.CCOCC.CNC.Cc1ccccc1.O.[LiH]; Answer2: The functional groups in the reactants are ketones, amides, halogens, and t-butyl. After the reaction, the functional groups in the products are ketones, amides, halogens, t-butyl, and ethoxy. Therefore, the change of functional groups during the reaction is the formation of ethoxy."
CCOC(=O)CC#N.O=C(c1ccc(F)cc1)c1ccc(F)cc1,CC(=O)O.NCCC(=O)O.c1ccccc1,Answer1: The possible product SMILES is CC(O)O.CCOC(=O)C(C#N)C(O)(c1ccc(F)cc1)c1ccc(F)cc1.NCCC(=O)O.c1ccccc1; Answer2: The changes of functional groups during the reaction include the conversion of terminal aldehyde and carbonyl methyl groups in the reactants to additional alcohol groups in the products.
